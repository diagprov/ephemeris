# What is this?

The app Omnifocus looks like quite a good tool for tracking all the things I 
have to do. What I'd like is an equivalent tool, but with:

 * Human-ish-readable backing files (that could for example be committed to git),
 * A console as well as GUI tool.
 * Linux support.
 * Input from other data sources, such as calendars or whatever.
 * Timezone support so I can see when an event occurs in another location.

This seemed like the perfect excuse not to do `#[no_std]` rust, that is, actually 
use the standard library and all the crates. Plus I can try out gtk-rs.

# What is the license?

Well there's a very high chance it will become abandonware so, I set it to MIT 
but whatever, it is todo app.

# I've found a bug!

Fake news. It is written in Rust. It doesn't have any bugs!
